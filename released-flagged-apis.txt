# This file contains a list of feature flags whose corresponding API should be
# included in the next SDK extension. This allows APIs to be released in an SDK
# extension without removing @FlaggeApi annotations from the source which means
# those APIs will be hidden from the next QPR release.
#
# These flags are converted into command line options that are passed to
# Metalava when generating API signature files and stubs for SDK snapshots for
# previous dessert releases, e.g. R, S, Tiramisu, etc. and also for the next
# SDK extension (and eventually Android SDK) release.
#
# Flags must only be added to this once they are suitable for release and only
# immediately before the next SDK extension is to be created. Adding them here
# before a normal train release will cause additional APIs to be included in
# that train release.
#
# Flags must only be removed from this once the corresponding @FlaggedApi
# annotations are removed from the source code which can only be done once those
# features have been approved for general release.
#
# Once an SDK extension has been created it will not be possible to use any of
# the flags in this file in any new @FlaggedApi annotations as otherwise that
# would cause those APIs to be included in SDK snapshots used by the next train
# release.
#
# The file should be structured in sections with flags in alphabetical order
# within each section. Each section should be separated from the preceding one
# by a comment indicating which SDK extension the section relates to.
